  1. **_Day 1_: Oct 03, 2020**
      - I decided to rebuilt the "Hero's Smoke Shop" hero section, because I realized that I need to use Flexbox in order to make the  website responsible designed;
      - It was included "nav" section, with the Logo on the left side and the Menu on the right side;
      - TODO:
        - Make Menu pretty;
        - Create subscribe button.

      - **My challenge** 
        - I took a while to get the menu aligned on the right side of the "nav" section;
        - I am also still having difficult to set transparency to background-image.

  2. **_Day 2_: Oct 04, 2020**
      - The Menu is pretty;
      - The subscribe button was created;
      - I decided to delete the background-image, because it was not clean, good to see it;
      - TODO: 
        - Choose another background-image or leave without it?
        - Make subscribe button pretty;
        - Create subscribe form.
   
      - **My challenge**
        - I had difficult to align the button to the center of the page. I tried different ways, like align-items and align-content but I wasn't successeful doing that. The temporally solution for that was creating a margin-top with 3em units.

  3. **_Day 3_: Oct 05, 2020**
      - The subscribe button is pretty;
      - The subscribe form was created;
      - First push to GitHub ("first commit") to keep the project safe in case if I have problem with my computer;
      - TODO:
        - Make subscribe form pretty;

      - **My challenge**
        - It took me a while to find out how to create a select menu, it was not given in class yet;
        - It is being a challenge keeping the code clear, organized and semantic, because it is getting new lines every day.

  4. **_Day 4_: Oct 06, 2020**
      - I set up another background image. Looks much better, following the Visual Hierarchy teory;
      - I deleted the subscribe button. I missunderstood the task, there is no subscribe button.
      - The subscribe form is almost done.
      - TODO:
        - Make the subscribe form pretty;
        - Find a better space to the "h1" and "p" tags;
        - Organize the code.

      - **My challenge**
        - No challenge today.
  
  5. **_Day 5_: Oct 07, 2020**
      - The Hero section with the form is done. 

      - **My challenge**
        - I had difficult to place the "h1", "p" and "form" in row and aligned.
